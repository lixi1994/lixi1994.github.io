    <h4>CS652/752 Advanced Algorithms and Applications</h4>
    
    <h5>Course Overview</h5>
    <p>
        This course provides an in-depth study of fundamental algorithms and data structures, focusing on their <strong>design, analysis, and application</strong> in solving real-world problems. Students will explore key algorithmic paradigms, such as divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms, while also learning techniques for analyzing algorithm correctness and efficiency using mathematical induction and asymptotic notation. The course aims to equip students with the skills needed to develop efficient and scalable solutions to computational problems, laying a strong foundation for advanced studies in computer science.
