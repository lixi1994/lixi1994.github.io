    <h4>CS652/752 Advanced Algorithms and Applications</h4>
    
    <h5>Course Overview</h5>
    <p>
    The study of algorithms will enable you to reason about the core computational structure underlying a problem and equip you with a rigorous set of techniques to solve such problems. 
    The design and analysis of fundamental algorithms underpins numerous fields of importance ranging from data science, business intelligence, finance and cyber security to bioinformatics. 
    Algorithms to be covered include dynamic programming, greedy technique, linear programming, network flow, sequence matching, search and alignment, randomized algorithms, page ranking, data compression, and quantum algorithms. 
    Both time and space complexity of the algorithms will be analyzed. Formalization, mathematical proofs will play a key role in the class.
