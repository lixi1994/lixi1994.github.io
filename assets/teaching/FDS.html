    <h4>CS685/785 Foundation of Data Science</h4>

    <h5>Course Overview</h5>
    <p>
    This course explores essential concepts and techniques in statistical inference and big data analytics. 
    It covers a broad spectrum of topics, including data fundamentals, analysis in high-dimensional spaces, singular value decomposition (SVD), principal component analysis (PCA), random walks, and Markov Chains. 
    Additionally, it includes a special topic on the ethical implications of big data -- security, privacy, and fairness, explored through reading research papers. 
    Students will engage in practical learning through coding assignments and hands-on projects to gain practical experience and exposure to cutting-edge techniques.
