    <h4>CS685/785 Foundation of Data Science</h4>

    <h5>Course Overview</h5>
    <p>
    This course explores essential concepts and techniques in statistical inference and big data analytics. 
    It covers a broad spectrum of topics, including data fundamentals, analysis in high-dimensional spaces, singular value decomposition (SVD), principal component analysis (PCA), random walks, Markov Chains, as well as data streaming and sketching techniques. 
    Additionally, it includes a special topic on the ethical implications of big data (such as data privacy and security), explored through reading research papers. 
    Students will engage in practical learning through coding assignments and hands-on projects to gain practical experience and exposure to cutting-edge techniques.

        <!-- Assignments -->
        <!-- <h6>Assignments</h6> -->
        <p>
            <strong>Assignments:</strong> This course includes both coding and written assignments to enhance learning and practical application. There are 3-4 coding assignments using popular programming languages and tools such as Python, Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn, aimed at providing substantial hands-on experience in data science. The written assignments are designed to reinforce the theoretical concepts and knowledge acquired in class.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Master’s students will complete the coding assignments.</li>
            <li>PhD students will complete both the coding and written assignments.</li>
            <li>All assignments must be completed individually, as teamwork is not permitted.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Group Projects -->
        <!-- <h6>Group Projects</h6> -->
        <p>
            <strong>Group Project:</strong> The final project in this course allows students to select from a range of topics for exploration and analysis. Students are permitted to form teams. A report is required, which will encapsulate the project’s methodology, analysis, and individual contributions.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Master’s students can form teams of up to 5 members and produce a minimum 4-page report.</li>
            <li>PhD students may form a team of up to 3 members and produce a report of at least 8 pages. Additionally, PhD students are required to present their findings in class, showcasing their collaborative work and insights.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Final Exam -->
        <!-- <h6>Final Exam</h6> -->
        <p>
            <strong>Final Exam:</strong> The final exam is a comprehensive test covering all topics discussed throughout the semester. It will be conducted in a closed-book format to assess your understanding and integration of the course material. Additional details will be provided as the exam date approaches.
        </p>

        <!-- Research Paper Review -->
        <!-- <h6>Research Paper Review</h6> -->
        <p>
            <strong>Paper Review</strong> Students are required to individually select a research paper from a provided list and write a review. These reviews should critically assess the paper's contributions, methodology, and results.
        </p>

        <!-- Participation -->
        <!-- <h6>Participation</h6> -->
        <p>
            <strong>Participation:</strong> Participation is assessed through in-class quizzes. Quizzes consist of multiple-choice questions accessible via Canvas on a phone or laptop.
